  "summary": "Alan Mathison Turing(/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an Englishmathematician,computer scientist,logician,cryptanalyst,philosopherandtheoretical biologist.He was highly influential in the development oftheoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts ofalgorithmandcomputationwith theTuring machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purposecomputer.Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science.",
